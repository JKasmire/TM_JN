    "- a set of tweets, \n",
    "- the full text of an 18th centrury novel,\n",

    "- random gibberish letters and numbers, or\n",
    "- just about anything else in text format. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval is a very important step, but it is not the focus of this training series. If you are particularly interested in creating a corpus from internet adat, then we recommend you check out our previous training sessions on Web-scraping (recording or jupyter notebook) and API's (recording or jupyter notebook) Both of these demonstrate and discuss ways to get data from the internet that you could use to build a corpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, for the purposes of this session, we will assume that you already have a corpus to analyse. This is easy for us to assume, because we have provided a sample text file that we can use as a corpus for these exercises. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's check that it is there. To do that, click in the code cell below and hit the 'Run' button at the top of this page or by holding down the 'Shift' key and hitting the 'Enter' key. \n",

As a result, the 'bag of words' will miss out on the noun-verb distinction for 'building' in:\n",
