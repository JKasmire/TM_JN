    "- random gibberish letters and numbers, or\n",
    "- just about anything else in text format. \n",

    "Retrieval is a very important step, but it is not the focus of this training series. If you are particularly interested in creating a corpus from internet adat, then we recommend you check out our previous training sessions on Web-scraping (recording or jupyter notebook) and API's (recording or jupyter notebook) Both of these demonstrate and discuss ways to get data from the internet that you could use to build a corpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, for the purposes of this session, we will assume that you already have a corpus to analyse. This is easy for us to assume, because we have provided a sample text file that we can use as a corpus for these exercises. \n",
