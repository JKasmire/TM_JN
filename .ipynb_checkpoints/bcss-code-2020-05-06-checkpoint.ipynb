    "Computational Social Science: it can be a scary, alluring, mystifying term. You may even be thinking, what's the big deal? Surely almost all social science involves the use of computers: we code our interviews using software such as NVivo; build our statistical models in SPSS, Stata etc; and generally conduct our research and teaching activities within a computational environment (e.g., personal desktop/laptop, Dropbox or iCloud for file storage). However, computational social science (CSS) refers to activities and technologies that go beyond what we're typically familiar with as social scientists:\n",
    "* The use of datasets that are too large to store on your personal machine; \n",
    "* Writing programming scripts to access information held in online databases; \n",
    "* Employing analytical techniques, derived from computer science, that reveal structures and patterns in large or unfamiliar datasets (e.g. network analysis, text mining). \n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, CSS is an interdisciplinary branch of research, defined more by its methods and data than its substantive topics (Heiberger & Riebling, 2016). CSS is not limited to certain analytical approaches (e.g., Machine Learning) or data types (e.g., text data). So what makes CSS different from \"traditional\" social science? What are the techniques that are not well suited to familiar statistical software packages such as SAS, SPSS? And why would you want to be a computational social scientist?"

    "\n",
    " - Responding to stimulus, including dangers that are both fast (like tigers) and slow (like the approach of winter) as well as useful things (like resources). \n",
    " - Learning in order to turn the unknown into the known so it can be responeded to appropriately (as dangerous, useful, etc.).\n",
    " - Recognising patterns so as to respond more quickly to known patterns as stimulus or to pique curiosity and drive learning around new patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Less Basic Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Humans also have less basic problems that apply to fewer kinds of living things. Most notably, these only apply to social living things. In essence, a big problem for people is 'other people':\n",
    "\n",
    " - Understanding the intentions, or likely intentions, of the people around us. \n",
    " - Predicting likely next actions or responses. \n",
    " - The role of intentions, actions and responses within wider patterns like collaboration, competition or some combination of them both.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving these problems involve a kind of thinking that doesn’t exactly look like “thinking”. \n",
    " - People often respond to perceived dangers even before they were consciously aware of the danger. \n",
    " - People don't have to put a whole lot of mental effort into learning things like \"Avoid the snarling animal\" or \"Don't eat the bitter tasting fruit\". \n",
    " - People don’t really sit down and deliberately set out to compare the footsteps heard on the stairs against the known footsteps of the housemate or not. \n",
    " - People can recognise other people, read their faces, judge a situation and react all before they can consciously think about it.\n",

    "    - Heuristics  - We use a lot of 'rules of thumb' to short cut decision-making, speeding up how we arrive at 'good enough' solutions.\n",
    "- Communication assumptions according to Pinker, 2003 :\n",
    "    - Speaker and listener interpret the same way - We all assume others will understand something the way *we would have* understood it if we were the listener.\n",
    "    - Objects and actions as distinct - We assume new terms to be either objects or actions, but not both.\n",
    "    - Mid-level categories, but with knowledge of hierarchies - We assume a generic term like 'cat' to mean a household pet, rather than all felines in taxonomic terms or 'this particular cat, right now'. \n",
    "    - Transitive properties - We apply logical operations, so \"The book that is on the desk\" might actually mean \"the book on top of the paperwork that is on the desk\". \n",
    "- 2 types of thinking according to Kahneman, 2011:\n",
    "    - Fast, error-prone, intuition-based - this is the sub-rational stuff.\n",
    "    - Slow, (more) accurate, rationality-based - still not perfectly rational, but often with conscious effort involved"

    "#### Some problems need human and computer thinking\n",
    "\n",
    "Human thinking is typically needed to identify the problem, possible solutions, relevant info, etc. This is especially true of problems that deal with humans and human behaviour. For example, trying to predict how people will react to an innovation, a policy change, a new trend, etc. requires understanding and predicting how people will interpret new information, how they will apply that information to their diverse personal goals and fears, how they will choose to react (hopefully) in line with existing laws and societal norms, etc. At the same time, computer thinking is needed if dealing with that problem involves working accurately and reproducibly with large volumes of (complex) data. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine a new law is proposed that makes smart meters obligatory for all new houses. Social science researchers could think about how people might react to this new law - they might create some abstract scenarios, identify potential problems, identify similar new laws in the past and try to categorise human reactions to those laws, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "But if those social scientists want to know how people *actually* do react to this new law, then they will need to collect quite a lot of potentially very complex data, ideally from different sources (interviews, smart meter data, social media discussions, freedom of information requests, etc.). Those social scientists will need to employ computer thinking to integrate all of that vast and complex data in useful ways that might actually address the problem. \n",

    "The combination of human thinking and computer thinking to address social science problems through the use of potentially vast and complex data is, in a nutshell, what computational social science is all about. \n"

    "#### Computational Social Science is an Opportunity\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational social science (CSS) means working with new forms of digital data and analytical methods to address new problems or to address existing problems in new ways. Both of these mean that computational social science opens up a whole new galaxy of potential research opportunities! That's a rather grand statement but it's true: vast swathes of our daily lives, social interactions, activities and other behaviours are captured digitally. These are often aggregated into large and rich data sets, much of which is available with the right programming skills to access and manage data from websites, documents, records, images, corpora and algorithms. Accessing and using these new forms of data is only possible through computational means (Kitchin, 2014).\n",
    "\n",
    "Halford and Savage (2017) outline further advantages to engaging in CSS, especially from a data perspective:\n",
    "* Utilise techniques for handling and analysing large-scale, unstructured data. \n",
    "* Capture data that is generated in real time and over time.\n",
    "* Access information on new/previously unmeasured activities.\n",
    "* Access information on familiar/currently measured activities at an unprecedented scale, dynamism or complexity.\n",
    "* It's happening whether we (social scientists) like it or not (see also Heiberger & Riebling, 2016); empirical social science in general is having its moment in the sun, in much the same way the social theorists did in the recent past.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last, but certainly not least, there's more to CSS than boosting your research standing or productivity. I rather like Sociologist Dr James Allen-Robertson's thoughts on this:\n",
    "\n",
    "> In response to the question of what computational social science has helped me achieve, it may seem obvious to mention the concrete projects, the outputs, the measurable outcomes. However, for me computational social science has achieved something more substantial and enduring — a new way of working, a new way of thinking, and a new kind of enthusiasm for research.<sup>[1]</sup>\n",

But limitations aside, CSS depends on the ability *to write code* and *manipulate data*. \n",
    "\n",
    "These skills may not be easy to obtain as they require a mode of thinking and intellectual dexterity that you may not have practiced before. However, a little ability goes a long way. You do not need to be a software engineer to successfully scrape a website and you do not need to have a high-performance computing environment or server to manipulate data accessed through Spotify or Twitter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Brooker (2020) calls this approach the \"grilled cheese\" methodology for programming: your activities just need to be effective i.e., produce the results you need or expect. Elegance, concision and optimisation (e.g., shaving milliseconds off the running time of your code) can come later - or not at all - as a computational social scientist. The aim - in the short-term at least - is not to learn everything about a particular technique, but enough to achieve your research aim e.g., write an executable programming script for collecting data from Wikipedia; Dr James Allen-Robertson again:<sup>[1]</sup>\n",

    "The good news is that much of the code and tools necessary to be a computational social scientist are readily accessible and masterable in a short period of time (think weeks instead of months/years). Grasping and working with basic concepts is key to developing the foundation of computational thinking, which is the real skill needed for CSS. Remember that social science research is increasingly interdisciplinary and knowledge of CSS gives you an advantage for future research funding, academic positions, and more (Brooker, 2020). \n",

    "<!-- * We live in a world of data (what does that even mean?!?). In fact, we pretty much always have been, although in the pre-digital ages most of that data is probably not what we would consider to be “data” in the way that we understand it now. But it was data nonetheless! As data accumulated, it began to be a problem. How does someone remember it all? How can someone make sure that the right person has new data? How can someone get to the right bit of data at the right time? How best to ensure data is accurate? Fortunately, people developed some pretty good methods for dealing with the problems. These included systems for learning, transferring, testing and accessing data. For example; writing systems allowed data to be transmitted without relying on a specific living messenger being privy to the message, the scientific method allowed insights and discoveries to be replicated ensuring data accuracy, and the dewey decimal system allowed library goers to quickly zoom in on areas that are most likely to have relevant data.  The world of data that surrounds us now includes digital data... Obviously “data-ish” data. And, sensibly, we have developed some methods of dealing with digital data, some based on the data methods developed for non-digital data. Storage drives full of folders with sensible names, for example, are like digital versions of libraries with organised shelves. I am sure you can all imagine more examples.  But, problematically, our modern data world now includes some (very) fast data. Not all of the long-established data methods are well-suited to the fast-moving digital data. For example, the idea that data should be carefully divided into documents, labelled, and stored does not work especially well for data that is continuous, spread over many sources, subject to change, or that is most useful when rapidly accessed.   \n",
    "\n",
    "* Social sciences have traditionally used certain kinds of (slow) data \n",
    "* Social sciences may need to embrace computational thinking in order to use the (very) fast data  -->\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- What is data and how is it different than information? \n",
    "There is a subtle difference between data and information. Data are the facts or details from which information is derived. Individual pieces of data are rarely useful alone. For data to become information, data needs to be put into context. \n",
    "Data exists, as it were, out there in the world. Information is created, for a purpose, by interpreting data within a given context.  \n",
    "What kind of data are humans good at using? And computers? \n",
    "Humans tend to be good at finding patterns in messy, sparse or irregular data. This is to say, humans are good at deriving information out of minimal data. In theory, this is because we have an evolutionary drive to jump to conclusions as quickly as possible – it is better to flee from the tiger that you think you can hear creeping up behind you than to carry on gathering data about what might be causing the sound of approaching footsteps in the jungle. However, evolution-driven instincts are most applicable to evolutionary problems, so humans tend to be better deriving information efficiently from situations that involve immediate danger, other people, food, and other basic life situations. A good example is how almost all people acquire language in early childhood from the erratic and error-prone output of people around them under often difficult or unusual conditions. This is because language is a clear advantage for a species that reliably exists in a social and communicative context, both in the context of turning the jumble of noise that comes out of people’s mouths into coherent messages and in the context of language acquisition, in which a jumble of noise is turned into a syntax, vocabulary, etc.  \n",
    "Likewise, people are very good at detecting faces, even doing so in tortilla scorch marks or clouds of smoke, even though the detected faces are detected against strange backgrounds, in all lighting conditions, at unpredictable angles and contrary to all expectations. This is because detecting human faces, in a wide range of potentially surprising conditions, is also a clear advantage to a social species like humans. Consequently, humans are very good at picking up on some very subtle and complex patterns in very challenging conditions.  \n",

    "Though there are myriad aspects to the role, being a computational social scientist typically involves one or more of the following practices:\n",
    "* Writing programming scripts to collect and manipulate data.\n",
    "* Employing analytical techniques - many derived from computer/information sciences - to reveal patterns in data.\n",
    "* Using technological tools and e-Research best practice to structure and document your research workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is, as a trained social scientist, you do not need to learn al of these aspects from scratch and can instead apply the knowledge, skills and strengths that you have already! For example, social scientists possess knowledge - theoretical and empirical - of social systems and phenomena and already have advanced data skills, especially around:\n",
    " - categorising and coding responses (qualitative and/or quantitative), \n",
    " - evaluating data quality (e.g., why is this survey response missing?), and \n",
    " - making inferences from data (e.g., how representative is this pattern of a larger population?). \n",
    " \n",
    "Thus, main gaps in your skillset concern one or more of the following:\n",
    " - awareness of computational structure and processes, \n",
    " - experience with or knowledge of computational and/or data resources, \n",
    " - programming skills and knowledge of programming languages, and \n",

The father of this approach, Donald Knuth (n.d.), summarises its high level aim:\n",

    "* **Replicable**: A result is replicable when the same analysis performed on different datasets produces qualitatively similar answers.\n",
    "* **Robust**: A result is robust when the same dataset is subjected to different analysis workflows to answer the same research question (for example one pipeline written in R and another written in Python) and a qualitatively similar or identical answer is produced. Robust results show that the work is not dependent on the specificities of the programming language chosen to perform the analysis.\n",
    "* **Generalisable**: Combining replicable and robust findings allow us to form generalisable results. Note that running an analysis on a different software implementation and with a different dataset does not provide generalised results. There will be many more steps to know how well the work applies to all the different aspects of the research question. Generalised is an important step towards understanding that the result is not dependent on a particular dataset nor a particular version of the analysis pipeline.\n",
